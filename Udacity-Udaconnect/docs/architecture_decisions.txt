Architecture decision making:

Connection API (REST API):
The microservice is created without any change.

Frontend (REST API):
No change has been applied.

Person API (REST API):
The microservice is created without any change.

Location microservice (REST API):
The new architecture supports loading location from database.

Location generator (gRPC + Message Queue (Kafka)):
Loading location data is expected to have the ability of handling the large volume and streaming data while the location generator is relatively simple. The microservice, which uses
this location is smart and should recieve lossless messages. 
Hence, the Kafaka is the way forwad and the consumer queries the data from kafka and it handels is without any missing data.
Finally, the loading new location in the new architecture is done using gRPC (compared to REST, gRPC provides better performance) and Kafka which is more reliable at large volume of data.
